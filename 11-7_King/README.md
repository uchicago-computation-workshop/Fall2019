# How to Measure Legislative District Compactness If You Only Know it When You See it

**Summary:** 

To deter gerrymandering, many state constitutions require legislative districts to be "compact." Yet, the law offers few precise definitions other than "you know it when you see it," which effectively implies a common understanding of the concept. In contrast, academics have shown that compactness has multiple dimensions and have generated many conflicting measures. We hypothesize that both are correct -- that compactness is complex and multidimensional, but a common understanding exists across people. We develop a survey to elicit this understanding, with high reliability (in data where the standard paired comparisons approach fails). We create a statistical model that predicts, with high accuracy, solely from the geometric features of the district, compactness evaluations by judges and public officials responsible for redistricting, among others. We also offer compactness data from our validated measure for 20,160 state legislative and congressional districts, as well as software to compute this measure from any district.


[**Gary King**](https://gking.harvard.edu/biocv) is the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor at Harvard University -- one of 25 with Harvard's most distinguished faculty title -- and Director of the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](http://iq.harvard.edu/). 

King develops and applies empirical methods in many areas of social science, focusing on innovations that span the range from statistical theory, across qualitative and quantitative methodology, to practical application. He has reverse engineered Chinese censorship and fabrication of social media posts, improved Social Security Trust Fund forecasts, and developed empirical methods and software widely used in academia, government, and private industry for automated text analysis, rare events, missing data, measurement error, causal inference, interpreting statistical results, and for forecasting elections, mortality rates, and international conflict. 

King's ongoing international [Dataverse project](https://dataverse.org/about) supports the data sharing movement across fields. He is also an experienced entrepreneur. He is co-founder and an inventor of the various original technologies for which he has received 12 patents.
