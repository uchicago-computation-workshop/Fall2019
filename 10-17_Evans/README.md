### The Computational Social Science Workshop Presents

# James Evans 
### University of Chicago


The [Computation Workshop](https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/computation-workshop) at the University of Chicago cordially invites you to attend this week?s talk:

## Science and Technology Advance through Surprise

**Summary:** Breakthrough discoveries and inventions involve unexpected combinations of ?contents? including problems, methods, and natural entities, and also diverse ?contexts? such as journals, subfields, and conferences. Drawing on data from tens of millions of research papers, patents, and researchers, we construct models that predict more than 95\% of next year?s content and context combinations with embeddings constructed from high-dimensional stochastic block models, where the improbability of new combinations itself predicts up to half of the likelihood that they will gain outsized citations and major awards. Most of these breakthroughs occur when problems from one field are unexpectedly solved by researchers from a distant other. These findings demonstrate the critical role of surprise in advance, and enable evaluation of scientific institutions ranging from education and peer review to awards in supporting it.

### Thursday, 10/17
### 11-12:20 PM 
### Henry Hinds Laboratory 101

[**James Evans**](https://macss.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans) is a Professor of Sociology, Faculty Director of the MACSS Program, a Fellow at the Computation Institute and the Director of the [Knowledge Lab](http://knowledgelab.org), at the University of Chicago. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture/novelty, ambiguity, topology/of human understanding.
