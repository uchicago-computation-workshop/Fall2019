### Stevanovich Center for Financial Mathematics 112
### 5727 S. University Ave.

*A light reception will follow the event.*

[**Jeremy Greene**](https://www.hopkinshistoryofmedicine.org/content/jeremy-greene) is the Director of the [Department of the History of Medicine](http://www.hopkinshistoryofmedicine.org/) and the Professor of Medicine and the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. He is interested in the history of disease, and his research explores the ways in which medical technologies come to influence our understandings of what it means to be sick or healthy, normal or abnormal. His most recent book, *Generic: The Unbranding of Modern Medicine*, narrates the history of generic drugs as a means of exploring problems of similarity and difference in modern medicine. His current project, *The Electronic Patient* examines how changing expectations of instantaneous communications through electric, electronic, and digital media transformed the nature of medical practice and medical knowledge.  

[**Andrey Rzhetsky**](https://www.knowledgelab.org/people/detail/andrey_rzhetsky/) is a Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Human Genetics, as well as a Senior Fellow at the Computation Institute and Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, at the University of Chicago. His research is focused on computational analysis of complex human phenotypes in context of changes and perturbations of underlying molecular networks. The input data for these studies is supplied by large-scale mining of free text, computation over clinical records, and high-throughput systems biology experiments.


[**James Evans**](https://macss.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans) is a Professor of Sociology, Faculty Director of the MACSS Program, a Fellow at the Computation Institute and the Director of the [Knowledge Lab](http://knowledgelab.org), at the University of Chicago. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture?novelty, ambiguity, topology?of human understanding.
