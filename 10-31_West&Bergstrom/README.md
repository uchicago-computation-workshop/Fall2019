# Calling Bullshit

**5727 S. University Ave.** <br>

*A light lunch will follow the talk*
<br>


[**Jevin West**](https://jevinwest.org/) is an Associate Professor in the Information School at the University of Washington. He co-founded the DataLab and direct the Center for an Informed Public. He studied the *Science of Science* and worries about the spread of misinformation. His laboratory consists of millions of scholarly papers and the billions of links that connect these papers. He develops *knowledge discovery tools* to both study and facilitate science. In particular, he is interested in the origin of scholarly disciplines and how sociological and economic factors drive and slow the evolution of science.

[**Carl Bergstrom**](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/carl-bergstrom) is a Professor Computational Biology and Behavior at the University of Washington. The unifying theme running throughout his work is the concept of information. Within biology, he studies how communication evolves and how the process of evolution encodes information in genomes. In the philosophy and sociology of science, he studies how norms and institutions influence scholarsâ€™ research strategies and, in turn, our scientific understanding of the world. Within informatics, he studies how citations and other traces of scholarly activity can be used to better navigate the overwhelming volume of scholarly literature. Lately he's become concerned with the spread of disinformation on social networks, and interested in figuring out what we can do about it.
